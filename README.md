# Advent of Code 2023
For this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzle competition, I'll be working mainly in Python or C (and sometimes both!).  I'm not really going for speed, but simply for completion.  Hoping to have some opportunities to try out some Python syntax/libraries that I haven't used before, too.
